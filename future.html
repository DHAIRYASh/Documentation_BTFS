            <h2>Future Scope of the Web App</h2>
            <p>This document outlines potential future enhancements and expansions for the web application to evolve into a more comprehensive e-commerce platform.</p>
            
            <h3>Expandable Book Catalog</h3>
            <p>The web app will be able to add more books to the books data dynamically. This enhancement will allow easy updating and addition of new books to the <b>DiscoverBook</b> component, making the app scalable and content-rich.</p>
            
            <h3>E-Commerce Platform Integration</h3>
            <p>Transforming the app into a full-fledged e-commerce platform. This includes enhancing payment, address, and review functionalities, providing users with a seamless shopping experience. The already created pages for these functionalities lay a solid foundation for this expansion.</p>
            
            <h3>Admin Dashboard Enhancement</h3>
            <p>Developing an admin dashboard that connects the front end to the backend for real-time data fetching. This feature will enable the admin to fetch and display real-time user data, orders placed, and other analytics directly from Firebase. The dashboard will be accessible through admin login credentials, ensuring security and administrative capabilities.</p>
